			Catching
			</question>	
			<br>
			Catching pokemon is the most basic task in PokemonGo, in order to do so a player
			must have pokeballs. A pokemon is caught when it is hit with a pokeball and shakes
			3 times. You can increase chances of capture by great/ultra ball use, raspberries
			and nice/great/excellent/spin throws. Great/Ultra balls have a chance at dropping at pokestops.
			Raspberries also drop at pokestops. Lastly throwing the ball is a large part, 
			to get a nice/great/excellent throw you must hit the small ring on the pokemon.
			To get a spin ball you must rotate the ball before throwing by drawing small circles on
			the ball, then hit the pokemon.

			<question>
			Teams
			</question>	
			<br>
			Teams in Pokemon go are Instinct, Valor and Mystic. So far there are no identifiable 
			perks to any team. when you reach level 5 you are forces to choose one of the three
			teams. This lets you participate in gym battles.
			<br>
			<question>
			Gyms
			</question>	
			<br>
			Gyms are places where teams battle to control a area, opposing teams are allowed to attack
			gyms while players of the already controlled gym are allowed to train the gym to put more
			pokemon in to defend it. Holding gyms for 21 hours then gives 10 pokecoins that you claim
			in the shop. This is the only way to get pokecoins without hacking, or paying.
			<br>
			<question>
			Eggs
			</question>	
			<br>
			Eggs are received from pokestops. To hatch an egg the player must put it in a
			incubator then walk either 2k,5k or 10k. The amount of distance required to hatch an egg
			corresponds with the rarity of the pokemon.
